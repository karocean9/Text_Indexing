ABSTRACT
Throughout the history of computing, there have been several paradigm shifts from main-frames to mini computing to
microprocessing to networked computers. On track to be the
next major paradigm shift is that of cloud computing. While
the definitions are still being debated (see: http://videos.
techielife.com/what-is-cloud-computing/video-online/
2008/11/13), fundamentally, cloud computing can be defined as a push in designing services where information is
stored and processed on the Internet (i.e., “the cloud”) usually via massive large scale data centers which can be accessed remotely through various clients and platforms [18,
2]. Cloud computing itself has often been referred to as a
conglomeration of ideas such as Software as a Service, Web
2.0, grid computing, and utility computing [2]. In essence,
cloud computing is an umbrella concept which attempts to
synthesize and encapsulate this over arching movement of
access anywhere, process anywhere while abstracting the entire process to the user masking it in the cloud.
The advantages of cloud computing is that it offers enormous
amounts of power in terms of computing and storage while
offering improved scalability and elasticity. Moreover, with
efficiency and economics of scale, cloud computing services
are becoming not only a cheaper solution but a much greener
one to build and deploy IT services [7, 6]. For example, in
terms of processing power potential, Google recently used
its cloud computing infrastructure to process and sort one
petabyte of data in six hours [5]. In terms of time and cost,
the New York Times used Amazon Web Services to process
and convert an archive of 11 million articles in less than a
day and for a fraction of the cost [8].
Cloud computing is quickly taking the IT community by
storm as more platforms, applications, and services are being developed for cloud computing. While many users may

have never heard of cloud computing, a recent report by
Pew Internet Life found that 69% of Internet users are already using a type of cloud computing based application
[14]. Furthermore, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, IBM, Yahoo, Oracle, and Salesforce are all heavily investing in cloud
computing as the future of computing. Industry experts estimated the current market for cloud computing to be worth
$160 billion [2]. Acknowledging its importance, in terms of
education, Google and IBM have put forward an academic
initiative with six major universities to help explore and foster research in the area of cloud computing, of which four of
the six universities are iSchool members [12].
Given this, researchers in the academic community and interested parties in the IT and business world are just now
exploring new and exciting ways to harness the true power
of the cloud, however key legal and policy questions remain
unanswered [10].
These problems include both new policy issues unique to
cloud computing and existing technology/policy issues, including:
• Jurisdiction and regulation (Where and how will
it be governed?)
• Ownership of Data (Who owns the data in the cloud?)
• Data Portability (Can you migrate between services?)
• Data Retention/Permanence (What happens to
data over time?)
• Intellectual Property
• Security and Privacy (How is data secure and protected?)
• Reliability, Liability and Quality of Service (What
happens when the cloud fails?)
• Government Surveillance (How much data can the
government get from the cloud?)
• Monopolization of computing
• Net Neutrality

Moreover while looking at these problems, we need to consider the stakeholders involved in cloud computing. The
stakeholders are cloud platform providers, software developers building applications on the cloud, general consumers,
researchers, and the government including policy makers.
The primary questions revolve around how cloud computing
will be regulated. If the goal of cloud computing is to transcend location of both processing and storage, the obvious
quandary is: How will it be regulated and where will the
boundaries of jurisdictions form inside the nebulous cloud?
While cloud providers tout the feature of “locationlessness”,
boundaries do not disappear and geography does and will
matter in terms of law and regulation. Will the jurisdiction
be dictated by where these data centers are located, where
the data is temporarily stored, by the contractual agreements cloud users agree to, or something wholly different?
In terms of monopolization of computing, in 1943, Thomas
Watson SR, former chairman of IBM, said that the total
world market for computers would not exceed five [3]. While
five years ago this would seem laughable to many in the
IT community, with cloud computing this may no longer
be a funny mis-prediction, but some what eerily truthful.
Cloud computing data centers, plainly speaking, are massive amounts of computers all functioning together as one
supercomputer. With economics to scale and network effects, we may see a future with only a handful of cloud computing providers in which the world will do their computing
on [10]. Therefore, there are concerns of the potential for
cloud monopolies to form.
This push towards moving the responsibility of processing
and storage of information away from the end user has clear
ramifications in terms of privacy and data retention [15].
Who owns the data that is uploaded or generated on the
cloud and what can the providers of cloud services do with
this information? Other concerns, as vocalized by free software advocate Richard Stallman, come from the move towards computing as a service, which pushes data ownership
and control towards these service providers [11]. Stallman,
has called cloud computing a “trap” that will take control
and freedom away from users and force them into an unnecessary dependency. What happens when individuals are no
longer the stewards of their own digital environment?
What are the possible ramifications to society and culture
as data is amassed, stored, and retained for long periods
in the cloud? [13, 15] Cloud computing is, in effect, making
supercomputer-like power readily available to anyone. Given
its storage and processing power, more data can be stored
and processed by everyone. With modern society creating
increasingly larger amounts of data, cloud computing could
be the ultimate storage answer to this exabyte flood of data
[17]. However, what happens now that we have the ability
to store more information for indefinite periods of time?
In terms of reliability and liability, technology is not perfect and failures can and have occurred in cloud computing platforms. In February 2008, Amazon’s Web Services
(specifically Amazons S3 cloud storage infrastructure) went
down for several hours, causing data loss and access issues
with multiple Web 2.0 services [4]. This type of failure is

by no means a unique event [16]. With more services being
built on top of cloud computing infrastructures, an outage
or failure can create a domino effect, effectively taking down
large amounts of Internet services and Internet based applications. In cases of failure, what forms of arbitration exist for stakeholders, and what is the responsibility of cloud
providers?
In terms of government intervention, how will cloud computing function with existing regulation such as the Patriot
Act, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), COPA (Child Online Protect Act), Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and federal discovery regulation requirements? For example, many countries are leery of using cloud computing
services because of the potential for data to be exposed to
the US government via clauses of the USA Patriot Act [1].
How will regulations adapt to cloud computing and how will
cloud computing evolve to fit existing regulations?
The policy implications may appear to be endless, but solutions do exist. Given the potential impact of cloud computing, these problems will not remain unresolved and will
eventually be answered [9]. The question is how? A proactive approach, in the form of education and policy analysis,
is necessary to ensure that cloud computing will succeed and
that vested stakeholders are protected [10].
Therefore, this poster will provide an overview of cloud computing and its policy implications. In addition the poster
will be used as a springboard to discuss the opportunities
for research that exist for iSchools.
