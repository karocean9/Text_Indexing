ABSTRACT
To identify what information resources the professors use to
support their research activities and how they use them in the
electronic age, this paper surveyed 637 faculty members from five
research universities across the nation. Three questions were
asked including the five most important specific resources, how
many articles they retrieved from 13 channels of sources, and
which search engine (Google vs. Library’s homepage) they
preferred to use. Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis,
regression analysis and binomial test were used to analyze the
data. Factors including age, gender, and disciple are related to
choice of particular information sources. We find that most of the
faculty members still rely on electronic journals. Preferences were
evenly divided regarding using library’s search page versus a
Google search page.

1. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of online resources and databases and
the emergence of Web 2.0 technology, there has been a dramatic
change in the scholarly communication. In an effort to understand
how the faculty members of universities respond to the electronic
transformation and highlight how they use information resources,
637 professors in the field of science and engineering from five
research universities—University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
(UNC), University of Florida (FL), University of Oklahoma (OU),
Colorado State University (CSU) and University of South Florida
(USF) were surveyed about their information seeking behavior in
this study.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 Survey Questionnaire
The survey (http://ils.unc.edu/bmh/isb/National-ISB-Survey.pdf)
used in this study is part of the National Survey of Information
Seeking Behavior of Scientists
(http://bioivlab.ils.unc.edu/sandbox/ISB_national_survey/index.ph
p/Information_Seeking_Behavior_National_Survey) conducted by
the NeoRef research group led by Dr. Hemminger at University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The original survey attempted to
quantify academic scientists’ transition to electronic
communications, and how this affected different aspects of
information seeking. The data of this paper was cleaned and
imported into SAS 9 for analysis. Descriptive statistics,
exploratory factor analysis, and logistic regression analysis were
done on these data, resulting in both descriptive and exploratory
results.

2.2 Study Populations and Demographics
The 637 subjects of this study are faculty members of UNC, UFL,
OU, CSU, and USF, five research universities across America.
This is a subset of the complete national study which included
graduate students and other researchers. Included in the faculty
are professors with tenure (full professor and associate professor)
and without tenure (assistant professor) from 46 disciplines
including science, engineering, and medical science. Social
science and humanities are not included in this study because our
focus is academic scientists. The average age of the participants is
48 with standard deviation of 11. Gender is not balanced since the
majority(69%) are males. The distribution of the academic
position by professor, associate professor, assistant professor is
42.33%, 25.43%, and 32.34% respectively.

3. RESULTS
The first question asked the professors to list five most important
individual sources (journals, websites, listservs, etc) for them to
stay current in their field. Table 1 lists the top 10 sources
mentioned by faculty. Seven of the 10 sources are journal titles.
Of the 7 journals in the top-10 list, Nature, Science, and
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences are the
generally-focused and highly impact journals. The other four are
from areas of biology and chemistry.

There is som
me agreement on a few common
c
sourcces of
information as the most comm
monly utilized sources (for innstance
Science and Nature
N
are the toop two journalss). Most reseaarchers,
though, use many
m
different and varied souurces. As shoown in
Figure 1, overr 1100 resourcees are listed byy the participannts and
over 900 resouurces are listed oonly once. Therrefore, there is a “long
tail” of the curvve and the distrribution of the data appears too be the
Power Law disstribution. Thiss means the vaast majority of faculty
members havee their own inndividual selecttion of resourcces for
keeping currennt depending on their fields andd interest.

Inn evaluating thee factors, it appears that two off the factors (Faactor
2, and Factor 4) neatly identify the information
n from lab and
coolleague respecctively. Factor 5 may be explaiined as identifyying
thhe most popularr sources, but also interestingly
y involves
exxternally requested resources ((interlibrary loaan, and documeent
delivery servicess).Even more diifficult to explaain is factor 1, which
w
iss confounded byy both library subscribed and personally
p
suubscribed journnals. As all the ffive factors are considered, wee
coould infer that the
t factors are m
more directly tied to the
innformation channnels (e.g., lab subscriptions and
a colleague coopy
shharing than the information forrmat (electronicc, print) in
cllustering differeent informationn sources.

To further examine the potential factors that impact the faculty’s
choices, logistic regression model is constructed for the binary
preference for Google and Library’s homepage search. Table 4
summarizes the regression results. According to Table 4, the
only factors have a significant effect were age and gender, with
younger professors and male professors preferring Google more

to start their search process. Although significant, the impact of
age on professors’ preference is rather weak.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Five conclusions are found:
1) More articles are retrieved from electronic journals
subscribed by library than from any other source
2) The overlap of journals used by the professors is rather
small due to their different background (disciplines, academic
positions, and demographics);
3) Faculty members prefer electronic format materials than
the print counterparts;
4) Preferences were evenly divided regarding using
library’s search page versus a Google search page to start;
5) A few people are starting to use innovative information
resources, e.g. blogs, wiki pages. However, most of the
professors have yet to adopt these newer collaborative tools, and
continue their traditional ways of finding information.
