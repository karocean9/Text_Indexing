ABSTRACT
Faceted navigation is useful for finding information on the Web,
but facets created by professionals do not represent users'
preferences and understandings of concepts. To make faceted
navigation more suitable for users and fulfill users’ needs, a user’s
perspective should be explicitly represented in the design of
browsing interface. This study performed facet analysis on
folksonomy tags to identify user-centric facets.

General Terms

Folksonomy expresses users’ preferences and needs since it
allows users to add their own tags based on their interests. Several
researchers have studied folksonomy and its usefulness for
classification or retrieval [1][2][3][4], but no research has
considered the use of its tags as “facets” in designing a websearching interface. Despite criticism that folksonomy tags are
ambiguous and uncontrolled terminology [5][6], in effect, this
very problem could play a significant role in reflecting real users’
views and their vocabulary. The purpose of this research is thus to
bring a more accurate user’s perspective into the design of the
faceted navigation.

2.1.1Faceted Classification

Faceted classification, Facet analysis, Faceted navigation, Facets,
Folksonomy, Tags, Web directories, Web navigation, Web
browsing, Web searching interface.

Faceted classification, which is based on the Colon Classification
scheme developed by Ranganathan [7], is an “analytico-synthetic”
scheme deriving from two processes: analysis (the process of
breaking down subjects into their elemental concepts) and
synthesis (the process of recombining those concepts into subject
strings). Taylor [8] defines “facets” as: “clearly defined, mutually
exclusive, and collectively exhaustive aspects, properties, or
characteristics of a class or specific subject.” Ranganathan [7]
originally postulated five fundamental categories: Personality,
Matter, Energy, Space, and Time (see Table 1).

1. INTRODUCTION
Effective searching and navigation of web resources is at the
forefront of issues related to the area of information organization.
Faceted classification has become widely used to organize
resources on the Web. Growing interests in the application of
faceted classification on the design of websites have led to
successfully providing users with findability of resources.
However, the faceted structures of faceted classification were
constructed by professionals, not by users. Although
professionally developed facet structures are consistent and
systematic, sometimes it is not easy for users to understand the
concepts of facets and their relationships. Those facets are mainly
based on controlled vocabulary and the priority of facets is not
represented by users’ preferences, leading to difficulty in finding
appropriate facets to their needs. To make faceted navigation
more suitable for users, users’ perspectives should be explicitly
represented in designing a browsing interface.

2.1.2 Faceted Classification for Organizing Web
Resources
There have been numerous studies regarding the application of
faceted classification on organizing web resources. Priss and
Jacob [9] discuss the adaptability and flexibility of a faceted
thesaurus for a better website design. La Barre [10] has studied
websites using faceted classification. Additionally, Flamenco
project has investigated the usefulness of hierarchical faceted
interface to help users’ web searching [11].
However, the faceted structures of faceted classification were
constructed by professionals, not by users. Hence, the concepts
and relationships of facets cannot be easily grasped, so users have
difficulty for finding appropriate facets. Although faceted
structures created by professionals are consistent and systematic,
sometimes users might get lost in browsing the faceted structures
because those facets are mostly based on controlled vocabulary
which users are not familiar with. The other problem with those
faceted structures is that the most interesting objects to users are
not represented in top-level categories in faceted hierarchy1, i.e.,
the priority of facets is not based on users’ preferences. Therefore,
to make the faceted web navigation more suitable for users, users’
perspectives should be explicitly represented in facets.

2.2 Folksonomy as User-centric Resource
Organization
The term, “folksonomy” was coined by Thomas Vander Wal in
2004. He describes “folksonomy” as “user-created bottom-up
categorical structure development with an emergent thesaurus”
[14]. Flickr, Del.icio.us, and LibraryThing are popular
folksonomy sites. The main characteristic of folksonomy is to
allow users to create and browse their own tags as well as tags
created by other users.

3. METHODOLOGY
This research employed the method of examining folksonomy tags
to identify user-centric facets reflecting a user’s point of view. An
exciting and important aspect of this research is to provide a new
angle for understanding folksonomy tags by considering them as
“facets.” Tags express properties of a category, and this
characteristic of tags corresponds to that of “facets,” in that a facet
describes “properties or characteristics of a class or specific
subject” [8]. For example, tags “school” or “science” are facets
that represent the properties of a category for kids. Aura [15] also
notes that a tag is labeled by “its characteristic attributes of
features, not by the categories to which it belongs.”
To identify user-centric facets, it is helpful to investigate how a
professional’s point of view is different from a user’s point of
view in terms of describing a domain. For the former, category

labels of in web directories were examined, and for the latter, tags
from a folksonomy were analyzed. Web directories are simple
taxonomies to organize web resources in a hierarchy. Taxonomy
is “a collection of controlled vocabulary terms organized into a
hierarchical structure” [16]. Web directories create the taxonomy
of categories named by indexers’ languages, i.e., controlled
vocabulary.
Category labels used in web directories can be regarded as
potential “facets”, in that each label represents the properties of a
unique domain. Glassel [17] and Hearst [18] also note that the
Yahoo directory uses “faceted metadata” in their top level
directory. The Yahoo directory combines the Regional category
with other hierarchical facets. For example, finding one starting
with the Education category will be guided to browse the
hierarchy under the Regional category, and as a result, the users
will get the information. The category paths below indicate how
the University of California, Berkley can be located in both
Education and Regional categories [18]:



Education > College and University > Colleges and
Universities >United States > U > University of California >
Campuses > Berkeley
Regional > U.S. States > California > Cities >Berkeley >
Education > College and University > Public > UC Berkeley

For the comparison of web directory categories and folksonomy
tags, facet categories from Aitchison et al. [19] were used,
because they have been extended to include different subject areas,
and they are more explanatory than Ranganathan’s categories [19].

3.1 Analysis of Categories in Web Directories
For a professional’s perspective, I collected category labels from
two popular web directories, i.e., the Open Directory Project
(ODP) and Yahoo. I selected one domain, “kids.”
The
characteristic of domain “kids” is that its user population includes
parents as well as kids. ODP has a category for kids named “Kids
and Teens” (http://www.dmoz.org/Kids_and_Teens/) in secondlevel categories, and Yahoo manages a separate directory for kids,
Yahoo!Kids (http://kids.yahoo.com/directory). I classified all
category labels by Aitchison et al.’s facets [19] which consist of
five main categories (i.e., Entities/things/objects, Attributes,
Actions/activities, Space/place/location/environment, and Time)
and their sub-categories (see Table 2).

Facets can be either “flat (containing a single level of
values) or hierarchical (containing multiple levels of values
in an ancestor-descendant structure).” [12] Also, it is noticeable
that faceted navigation systems allow users to navigate resources
hierarchically from a super category to its sub-categories [13].

4. DISCUSSION & FUTURE RESEARCH
3.2 Identification of User-centric Facets Based
on Folksonomy Tags
To identify user-centric facets, I collected folksonomy tags. I
chose one folksonomy site, Del.icio.us.com, and a total of 394
tags among “Related Tags” about the domain “kids” were
randomly collected and examined. Finally, 18 main tags were
selected and arranged by Aitchison et al.’s facets [19]. Table 3
shows the comparison of web directory categories and
folksonomy tags.

References,

Table 2 demonstrates similarity with slight variation in labeling
categories between two different web directories, in terms of the
same facets. Some labels were exactly the same in both
directories.
For
example,
“Arts,”
“Computer,”
and
“Entertainment” for the Entities/things/objects facet and “Game”
and “Sports” for the Action/activities facet were identically
named. Other labels were slightly different for the same facets.
For instance, both “School Time” and “School Bell” labels
described the same property, i.e., “school subjects” including
math, languages, science, and social studies. However, “School
Time” and “School Bell” labels required looking into all their
sub-categories to grasp the exact meaning due to their
metaphorical expression. Unlike these labels, the folksonomy tag
was named just “School” (see Table 3). It can be explained that
folksonomy tags do not need to be unnecessarily long. Also, it can
be implied that ambiguous or metaphorical terms as category
labels might be redundant from users’ perspectives, so rather
simple but clear terms would be better for users to understand
facets.

Table 3 indicates that there was a large difference between web
directory categories and folksonomy tags regarding most of facet
labels,
e.g.,
Entities/things/objects,
Attributes,
and
Action/activities facets. The folksonomy tags presented have two
significant implications in the design of a user-centric faceted
interface. First, those tags can be used to decide the priority of
facets in the structure. For example, it is suggested that tags
“Books,”
“Parenting,”
“Shopping,”
“Tutorial”
(for
Entities/things/objects facet) and “Party,” “Activities” (for
Processes/functions facet) could be used as main facets (e.g., toplevel categories) directly reflecting users’ preferences. Especially,
“Parenting” tag proves that users of kids-category are not only
kids but also their parents, and confirms that folksonomy tags
correctly explain user population. Second, tags “21st century
skills,” “Digital literacy,” and “e-Learning” illustrate users’
tendency toward up-to-date terminology by implying the growth
of interests in fast-changing technology.
Future research will be conducted with additional websites using
faceted navigation, and be complemented by statistical analysis
based the number of tags. Furthermore, the semantic and syntactic
relationships among tags can be identified to create a more
rigorous facet structure.

5. CONCLUSION
The faceted navigation has been effective for organizing resources
in websites, but their faceted structures have been mainly
constructed by professionals, not by users. To make the web
navigation suitable for users, users’ views should be reflected in
facets. The main contribution of this research is bringing a more
accurate user’s perspective into the design of a faceted browsing
interface. Its unique contribution is the examination of
folksonomy tags as user-centric facets.
