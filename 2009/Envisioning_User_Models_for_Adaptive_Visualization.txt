ABSTRACT
Adaptive search systems apply user models to provide better
separation of relevant and non-relevant documents in a list of
results. This paper presents our attempt to leverage this ability of
user models in the context of visual information exploration. We
developed an adaptive visualization approach for presentation and
exploration of search results. We simulated a visual intelligence
search/analysis scenario with log data extracted from an adaptive
information foraging study and were able to verify that our
method could improve the ability of traditional relevance
visualization to separate relevant and irrelevant information.

Keywords
Visualization, VIBE, User model, Query, Personalized Search.

1. INTRODUCTION
User modeling is a technique to support adaptive information
access by supplementing non-adaptive information access systems
with information about its users. Over the last 20 years, user
models have become very popular in the area of information
access systems [1]. Most recently, personalized Web search
systems [2] emerged as the most active area of research in user
modeling and personalization.
What makes user models attractive in a Web search context
is their ability to separate relevant and non-relevant documents
according to user information needs. Observing user actions over
time, a personalized search system attempts to capture user
interests at the task level and to represent it in the user model. The
personal difference or task context can then be applied to the
information provided by the systems.
Unlike text-based personalized search systems that make use
of ranked lists, spatial visualization approaches expand the onedimensional information space to 2- or 3- dimensional
representations of retrieved results, appealing to human
intelligence and human ability to analyze visual information. We
have tried to combine the ideas of user modeling and visualization
to develop a “best of both worlds” approach for assisting users in
their search process. We explored a promising technology that
applies user modeling in the context of spatial relevance
visualization, so that the personalized search task could be more
interactive and exploratory. Our pilot studies demonstrated that
the user model’s ability to separate relevant and non-relevant
documents could provide substantial assistance in an information
visualization context. In this paper we briefly present our adaptive
visualization technology and the evaluation result.

2. VISUALIZAING USER MODEL AND
USER QUERY USING VIBE FRAMEWORK
In personalized search systems, three important elements compose
the whole framework: query, user model, and the ranked list. The
users themselves provide the queries, and the system constructs
their user models by observing their actions. Among various
approaches, content-based user models are composed of important
keywords extracted during the user interactions and can represent
user interests. The system can return personalized search results
with these two input variables.
We tried to visualize these three elements using an application
named VIBE (Visual Information Browsing Environment) that
was originally developed by Olsen et al. [3]. We extended it to
implement an adaptive information access on top of the original
framework. VIBE is a reference point – called POI (Point of
Interest) – based spatial visualization system. The entities to be
visualized are allocated on a 2-dimensional space, and their
locations are determined by the similarity ratios to the POIs. For
example, if the similarity values of an entity between POIa and
POIb are 0.8 and 0.4, then the entity is placed in a position two
times closer to POIa than POIb because the similarity ratio is 2:1.
Therefore, entities are placed closer to the more similar POIs on
the screen. Users can drag the POIs interactively, and the entity
positions are updated on the fly following related POIs.
We defined two types of POIs: query POIs and user model POIs.
Query POIs are simply query terms that were entered by users.
User model POIs are the top N most important terms from the
user model. The locations of the documents are decided by their
similarity ratios to the POIs. Because the documents can be
represented as term vectors (bag of words approach) [4], the
similarity values between the documents and the POIs (query
terms or user model terms) can be easily calculated using standard
similarity measures, such as cosine coefficient.
Figure 1 shows an example of this visualization. Two query terms
(CONVICT and PARDON painted in yellow) and the five most
important user model terms (YEAR, POPE, ESPIONAGE,
PRISON, and RUSSIA painted in blue) are displayed as POIs.
Squares represent retrieved documents and are aligned according
to their similarities to the query terms and the user model terms.
For example, the squares distributed closer to PARDON represent
the documents that are more related to the query than the user
model and are more related to PARDON among two query terms.
Unlike the original VIBE that aligned the POIs on a circle by
default, we added two new default layouts: Hemisphere and
Parallel. Figure 1 shows the Hemisphere layout and Figure 2
shows the Parallel. This new idea was motivated by the fact that

we have two different group of POIs – query and user model POIs
– and need a means to visually separate them in the information
space.

We extracted 105 transaction records from the log data and fed
them into the proposed visualization framework as shown in
Figure 2. One important visual cue in this figure is the color of
documents (squares). By matching the topics the subjects were
asked to work on and the ground-truth data manually tagged by
humans beforehand, we were also able to mark each document as
“relevant” or “not relevant”. Therefore, the document color
represents this relevance information (green = relevant, red = nonrelevant). The relevance information was never visible to the
subjects during the previous study but was added later to the
simulation for the authors to observe the effect of the user model.

3. SIMULATING ADAPTIVE
VISUALIZATION WITH REAL DATA
In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive
visualization approach, we extracted log data from our previous
study, which is a personalized search study based on a simple
textual interface, and simulated the visualization with the data
using the adaptive VIBE framework. We extracted three
important categories of data from the log: queries, user models,
and the documents returned by the system.
We adopted a special type of user model for this study, which is
called a task model. It is equivalent to the conventional user
models in that it reflects user interests, but is more focused on
specific tasks. The subjects from the previous study were asked to
solve a specific task by entering queries, retrieve documents, and
save important textual passages they found using the personalized
search system. The system automatically extracts important terms
from the user-selected passages and constructs a user model.
Therefore, a user model consists of a set of terms. Each user
model term is weighted according to its importance (frequency).
Using the user query and the user model constructed in this way,
the system provides personalized search results to the subjects.

As shown in the simulation example (Figure 2), we can easily
observe that there is a separation between green and red squares,
i.e., relevant and non-relevant documents to the corresponding
topic. This effect of separation was observed from many of the
simulation results among the 105 log records. In order to
investigate this separation numerically, we calculated the
centroids (marked as green or red circles in Figure 2) of the
relevant and non-relevant document clusters and then compared
their horizontal positions. The centroid positions were achieved
by averaging the document positions within the corresponding
clusters. The reason why we compared the horizontal positions,
but not the vertical, was that the query and user model POIs were
separated horizontally. Table 1 shows the result. The average
horizontal positions of the relevant and non-relevant document
clusters were presented in pixels on a Java Swing plane where the
origin (x = 0, y = 0) is the left topmost position. The average
positions of the relevant document cluster centroids were greater
than the non-relevant document clusters for all three layouts,
suggesting that the relevant documents are positioned closer to the
user model. The differences were all statistically significant
(paired Wilcox signed rank test) and the separation was greatest
with the Parallel layout.

5. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we proposed an adaptive visualization framework by
using an extended version of VIBE. The simulation of the
proposed framework using the log data extracted from a
personalized search system suggests that our adaptive
visualization framework can spatially separate relevant and nonrelevant information. This separation will be able to help users
analyze and filter huge volumes of information.
