Background

Results

What can the data tell us about engagement and outreach?

iSchool collaboration with local, national or global constituencies
can be promoted through curricular programs, community
outreach, and partnerships with other nonprofit and for-profit
institutions and organizations on research and projects. iSchool
faculty, students, and supporters, including alumni, all play a
role in planning, promoting, implementing, and sustaining
these engagement efforts. Research institutions that are
committed to community engagement will need data from a
variety of sources to make these initiatives successful.

The importance of social connections

Career tracking of graduates can provide iSchools with useful
data for strategic planning of programs and engagement
activities. For some programs, alumni may be an untapped
resource, and regular communication with those who are
interested opens up potential partnerships with them, their
associates, and their employers. Retrospective surveys allow
an iSchool to reconnect with alumni who may welcome the
opportunity to re-engage with the program and faculty,
conduct research or provide support, or offer internships,
learning opportunities, or future jobs for students.

Methods
The study analyzes a subset of the data collected for the
Workforce Issues in Library and Information Science (WILIS)
project, a large-scale retrospective career survey of graduates of
North Carolina LIS programs (1964-2007). The subset of data
consists of respondents who graduated with a master’s degree in
information science from two of the North Carolina LIS programs
(1988-2007), N=171. All respondents completed a web survey
consisting of closed-ended and open-ended questions about their
education, employment history, career aspirations, as well as their
current ways of keeping in touch with their LIS program and their
interest in continuing this connection.

Career surveys can be used to assess this interest and solicit
ideas for collaborative ventures. Analysis of career data can also
help iSchool educators find out what types of jobs their
graduates are taking and the variety of organizations that
employ them, as well as the graduates’ perceptions of how well
the program prepared them for their professions. This type of
information informs curriculum design, pedagogical strategies,
internship placement, research project planning, and the
establishment of community partnerships.

Job and career satisfaction
• 88% are satisfied with their job.
• In the next year, only 13% plan
to leave their current job.

75% rated the overall experience at their
program as good or excellent, but
¾ 29% say the opportunity for mentoring from
alumni is poor or needs improvement.
¾ 26% say the opportunities for networking are poor or need
improvement.
¾ In contrast, only 6% rated the learning environment or teachers as
poor or in need of improvement.

• Placement concerns:
¾ “I was extremely disappointed in the lack of assistance from my
program in helping me to find an internship or a job.”
¾ “I wish my program would have been active in finding graduates
employment upon graduation.”
•

Recent alumni are staying connected to their program via email
(56%), newsletter (47%), fellow students (42%), website (36%), and
faculty (29%).

Professional social connections are valuable to students and alumni.
iSchools can maximize opportunities for students to network with alumni
by leveraging existing relationships, opening lines of communication, and
reconnecting with “lost” alumni. Post-graduation engagement efforts may
augment career placement activities, inform strategic planning, and help
to launch new programs.
WILIS is a collaborative research partnership of the UNC
Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science and
the UNC Institute on Aging.
