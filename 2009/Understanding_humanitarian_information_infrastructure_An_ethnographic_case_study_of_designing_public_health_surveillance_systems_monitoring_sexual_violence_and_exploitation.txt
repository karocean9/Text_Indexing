ABSTRACT
Sexual violence and exploitation (SVE) in conflict settings is an
under reported phenomenon that has challenged service delivery
and humanitarian intervention. A proposed solution to this
problem is to create a global SVE surveillance system to monitor
and assess SVE in conflict settings. This requires large scale
collaboration and technical systems design among many
humanitarian actors including United Nation agencies,
international non-governmental associations, and communitybased organizations. While the solution to design the SVE
surveillance system has been initiated, little is known about the
existing information infrastructure that these groups currently use.
A better understanding of the information infrastructure will
inform the design and increase the chances of success in
implementing a SVE surveillance system.
Related studies conducted in information studies by Susan Leigh
Star of large scale information infrastructures has provided a
relevant methodological theory for this particular study, known as
an ethnography of infrastructure. Ethnography of infrastructure
relies on qualitative and naturalistic investigative methods such as
in depth interviews. The study lends itself to generalizable
knowledge about data sharing, humanitarian information
infrastructure, and complex systems design.

research response. The development of the overall public health
surveillance apparatus is supported and promoted by many parties
including: international health and UN agencies, international
non-governmental organizations (INGOs), community based
organizations (CBO’s), local governments, human rights activists,
and public health and international development scholars. Similar
surveillance systems and standardizations include the Children
and Armed Conflict Monitoring, Reporting and Compliance
Mechanism (2008). Consequently, the growth of surveillance
systems is on the rise. And yet little is known about the existing
information infrastructure the surveillance systems are meant to
remedy and ultimately replace.
This study aims to describe and understand the humanitarian
information infrastructure using the case of the SVE surveillance
system. No doubt, an analysis of infrastructure that facilitates
design recommendations will also allow for an unpacking of
several critical concepts, which are taken for granted in the effort
to monitor and assess SVE. For gender, technology, and
development researchers as well as information studies
researchers, it is the unpacking of critical concepts like
‘standardization’, ‘classification’ and ‘surveillance’ in the context
of designing an SVE surveillance system that warrants the
research and will be of most interest.

In 2005 a technical consultation on Methods & Systems for the
Assessment and Monitoring of Sexual Violence and Exploitation
in Conflict Situations convened on behalf of the World Health
Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA), and the Social Science Research Council. Thirty-four
participants from various international non-governmental
organizations and UN agencies came together under the stated
goal to “initiate the design of a standardized system for the
assessment, monitoring, and reporting of sexual violence and
exploitation (SVE) in conflict affected settings” (Marsh, 2005).

Despite the stated research imperative, sexual violence and
exploitation is socially significant in that it disproportionately
affects women and young girls and its root causes are extreme
oppression and gender-inequality. This being the case, SVE is
grossly underreported.
Initiative to collect data are often
inconsistent or inflexible and therefore inadequate at meeting
local needs and cultural context. Interestingly, the humanitarian
effort to restore the rights and dignity of victims of SVE has
crossed into the information world. The humanitarian field seeks
technical solutions and information systems to facilitate and
remedy the ad-hoc information infrastructure their humanitarian
effort now rely on (Marsh, 2005; Basil & Saltzman, 2002). The
current mode toward fulfilling their lack of information
infrastructure has been through developing surveillance via
standardization, data-collaboration, and documentation; critical
notions for information studies.

This growing imperative to design large scale technical systems
that provide surveillance of global public health issues warrants a

This raises questions such as what is the role of classification and
standardized case definitions in the process of collecting data?

1. INTRODUCTION

How are indicators delegated and finally decided upon to measure
and monitor these large issues? What are the methods for
collecting this data? And how is the process of developing
standards creating the impetus for collaboration and knowledge
sharing?
While we know coordinating humanitarian services involves
coordinating data sharing during conflicts and complex
emergencies it is important to make explicit that the research and
systems discussed here have to do with saving and protecting the
lives of women and children. So, the ‘data’ we are referring to is
data that protects a child from being sexually exploited, killed, or
sick. Therefore, data protection needs, ethics, and accountability
for design cannot be overly stressed. Similarly, the surveillance
system and research must be dynamic enough to bridge and
collate data collected about an issue that touches diverse ranges of
conflicting paradigms between local and global classifications
about language, violence, reproductive health/ rights, and
exploitation.

2. RESEARCH AIMS
My research aim is to carry out an ethnographic study of
information infrastructure in the humanitarian field using the
design case of the SVE surveillance system in order to make
claims about specific properties of that infrastructure. Through a
process of data collection, coding and data analysis the research
will identify aspects of infrastructure that emerge in order to
facilitate a descriptive account of humanitarian information
infrastructure. I will also pursuit answers to the following
research questions:
What are the effects of standardization or formal classification in
the humanitarian sector?
How do we understand humanitarian work on SVE as affected by
standards and classification?
What are the values and ethics inscribed in the standardization and
classification/protocols?
