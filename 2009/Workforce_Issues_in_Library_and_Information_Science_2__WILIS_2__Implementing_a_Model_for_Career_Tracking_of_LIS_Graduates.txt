Background
WILIS 2 is a three year project (2007-2010) to create an
alumni tracking system that all LIS master’s programs
can potentially use. The project builds on WILIS 1, a
comprehensive study of career patterns of graduates of
LIS programs in North Carolina. LIS programs have
generally lacked the time and resources to systematically
survey their graduates. As a result, stakeholders lack an
adequate understanding of what happens to LIS
graduates. LIS educators, in particular, do not have
ongoing data about the extent to which their programs
meet students’ expectations, prepare them for the
workplace or meet continuing learning needs. Such an
understanding will assist in educating and managing the
LIS workforce more effectively.

Collaborative Development
WILIS 2 is using a Community Based Participatory
Research (CBPR) approach that “equitably involves all
partners in the research process and recognizes the
unique strengths that each brings” (Isrel, et al 1998). A
Project Advisory Committee consisting of LIS
educators, professional association representatives, LIS
employers, practicing professionals, and LIS students is
providing overall input throughout the project.
Representatives of 8 initial pilot sites are participating in
the design of the web-based survey instrument that will
be used to collect data from alumni. Survey tools and
findings from the WILIS 1 and 2 studies are available at
http://wilis.unc.edu/.

Project Activities
• Refine the WILIS 1 career tracking model so that it is
suitable for all LIS programs to use with their recent
graduates.
• Recruit as many LIS programs as possible to
participate in a staged launch of the career tracking
system; up to 33 programs will be funded.
• Conduct the surveys and provide access to results for
the participating LIS programs.
• Disseminate findings and publicize the availability of
the system.

• To build consensus on the essential elements of a
career tracking survey instrument.
• To develop a survey that has the potential to serve as
part of an ongoing career tracking system for all LIS
master’s programs.
• To explore the use of the tool as a basis for data and
information sharing among the LIS programs.
• To explore opportunities for sustainability of the shared
career tracking system with ALISE, IMLS and other
stakeholder groups in LIS education.
• To increase linkages among researchers, educators,
employers, and practitioners in the field.
